## Overview

GhostMapper is designed as a passive network mapping tool for red teaming and ethical hacking. By listening for ARP and ICMP packets, the tool identifies active hosts and gathers critical network details, all while maintaining a minimal footprint to avoid detection. Its simplicity and modular design make it a valuable addition to any cybersecurity professional's toolkit.
